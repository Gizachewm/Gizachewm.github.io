                <p align="justify"> Located in the historic city of Gondar, Ethiopia, the University of Gondar is one of the oldest and most well established higher education institutions in the country. Our University was established in 1954 as a Public Health College and Training Center (PHC & TC) in joint effort between the Imperial Ethiopian government, WHO, United States Operation Mission to Ethiopia, and UNICEF. Dictated by the pressing health needs that existed in the 1940s and 1950s the PHC & TC quickly became established as a pioneer center for public health practice serving as a key source of Ethiopia’s health professionals. It remains the Ethiopia’s oldest medical training institution.</p><br />

            <td>This was also the era that gave birth to the philosophy of team approach and community based teaching of health professionals. During the 1950s all 2nd year clinical nurses, sanitarians and 3rd year health officers would go out into the community and provide health promotion as well as preventative, curative and rehabilitative services. This early work has developed and evolved into the Team Training Program (TTP)within the current College of Medicine and Health Science.</td>
